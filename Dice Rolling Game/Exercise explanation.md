# Dice Rolling Game

### Write a program that simulates rolling a pair of dice. Each time the program runs, it should randomly generate two numbers between 1 and 6 (inclusive), representing the result of each die. The program should then display the results and ask if the user would like to roll again.

## Optional Enhancements

+ Modify the program so the user can specify how many dice they want to roll.
+ Add a feature that keeps track of how many times the user has rolled the dice
  during the session. This will require a counter that increments each time the
  dice are rolled.
